# cloudbase

A software kit to make a homebrew ftp (or anything else) cloud server.

# Instructions

# How to find the version

# License used

This code is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License, with modifications.
The modifications are that the files that the users themselves put onto the server that do not run the server itself do not have to be redistributed, only the cloud files needed to have a clean copy of that server.

# Goals

. To be a homebrewable alternative to Google Drive

. To have as many or more features as Google Drive

. To be free and opensource forever, for anyone to use for decades to come
